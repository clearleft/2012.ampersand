			<h2>&ldquo;Linotype: The Film&rdquo; is a new documentary film about printing, journalism and the 8th Wonder of the World.</h2>
		</hgroup>
		<p>Directed by Doug Wilson, the film is a feature-length documentary centred around the Linotype type casting machine. Called the &ldquo;Eighth Wonder of the World&rdquo; by Thomas Edison, it revolutionised printing and society. The film tells the surprisingly emotional story of the people connected to the Linotype and how it impacted the world. &ldquo;Linotype: The Film&rdquo; will be screened exclusively for Ampersand attendees at the <a href="/location">pre-party</a> and during the conference lunch break.</p>
		
		<p>Douglas will be on stage for 20 minutes to take your questions. Please email or tweet your questions to <a href="http://twitter.com/ampersandconf" style="-webkit-hyphens:none; -moz-hyphens:none; -ms-hyphens:none; hyphens:none">@ampersandconf</a> now or during the conference.</p>
